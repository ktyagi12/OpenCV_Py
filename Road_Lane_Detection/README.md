**ROAD LANE DETECTION FROM AN IMAGE AND VIDEO USING OPENCV PYTHON**

**TECHNOLOGY USED:** Python 3.x, Open CV

**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

**AIM:** Detect the road lanes from an image and a video input.

**TASKS:**

ROAD LANE DETECTION FROM AN IMAGE
1. Importing needed libraries.
2. Read the road image.
3. Detect the edges of the road using Canny Edge Detector.
4. Define the region of interest. Mask the road except the region of interest.
5. Draw line on the detected edges using the Probabilistic Hough Lines Transform.

ROAD LANE DETECTION FROM A VIDEO
1. Importing needed libraries.
2. Capture the input video and generate the output video object.
3. For every frame:
	
      3.1 Detect the edges of the road using Canny Edge Detector.
	
      3.2 Define the region of interest. Mask the road except the region of interest.
	
      3.3 Draw line on the detected edges using the Probabilistic Hough Lines Transform.
